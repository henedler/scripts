# Python script to calculate smearing in time, frequency and also residual delays and rates.
# Written by Eskil Varenius, spring 2014. The frequency averaging is exact, while the time
# averaging is a simple upper limit based on a point source at the north pole.
# Note that the calcualtions use the longest baseline, the baselines will infact be shorter
# at all times since there is always some projection angle to the source. Still,
# the numbers are useful as an upper bound.

# The total coherence loss should not be more than 10%, else the signal to noise might be too low even if correcting for
# the amplitude loss on longest baselines. (Without correcting for the amplitude loss, one will also get larger sources
# far from the phase center, which might affect the science - so beware of averaging too much!)

# Note that this script does NOT include any primary beam effects, make sure you are not limited by these.

# A longer explanation of the formulas is in Chapter 3 of the licentiate thesis by Eskil.
